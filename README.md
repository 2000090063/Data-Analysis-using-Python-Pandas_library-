# Data-Analysis-using-Python-Pandas_library-
Pandas is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like .csv, .tsv, or .xlsx. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with Matplotlib and Seaborn, Pandas provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.  The main data structures in Pandas are implemented with Series and DataFrame classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of Series instances. DataFrames are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (examples, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features of these instances.
